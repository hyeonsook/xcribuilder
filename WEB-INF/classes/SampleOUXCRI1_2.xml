			<dcterms:description>B01, BA (Honours) History, Undergraduate qualification, Open University</dcterms:description>
			<dcterms:description>Explore a diversity of people, places and periods, including the impacts of empires on world history, twentieth-century dictators, history of medicine, and global heritage.</dcterms:description>
			<dcterms:description>If you study this degree course you will develop and deepen your knowledge of a wide range of topics and periods in history, from antiquity to the late twentieth century. To help you achieve the required 360 credits, we recommend a number of alternative routes with different combinations of modules, each route identified with particular historical interests. You will undertake your study within a broad framework designed to meet high national standards for single-subject history degrees. You will develop a range of skills in knowledge management, oral and written communication, and information and communications technologies, all of which will be valued in the modern workplace.</dcterms:description>
			<dcterms:description>Many of these skills you'll gain through the study of this degree course will translate very smoothly into the modern workplace, which is increasingly concerned with effective knowledge management and communication technology. Employers in all fields put a very high value on anyone who can deal competently with a large amount of complex information and turn it to good use, so history graduates are sought after. The ability to select and analyse relevant data and to present conclusions concisely and logically is essential in most lines of work, as is the ability to communicate clearly both orally and in writing. Critical and creative thinking and the capacity for independent research develop initiative, another valuable asset in today's competitive environment.
